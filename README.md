# Bank-Currency-Authentication

The task here is to predict whether a bank currency note is authentic or not based on four attributes i.e. variance of the image wavelet transformed image, skewness, entropy, and curtosis of the image.

This is a binary classification problem and I used  a random forest classifier to solve this problem. Steps followed to solve this problem will be similar to the steps performed for regression.
